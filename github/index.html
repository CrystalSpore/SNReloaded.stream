	<p>My Github page is located <a href="https://github.com/CrystalSpore/">here</a>, which lists most of the projects that I have ever worked on & used GitHub on. Some projects that I have worked on that I feel are noteworthy include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://github.com/CrystalSpore/SNReloaded.stream">The code for this site</a>, which I've been iterating on over the course of many months. I run this site on an Ubuntu-Server out of my bedroom currently.</li>
	  <li><a href="https://github.com/TSP-molecule/ATOM">ATOM (A Tiny Object Modeler)</a> [This was my project for the Team Software Project class at MTU]. I developed the Python scripts to pull chemical data and Wikipedia entires from the internet, a Java interface to read output from the Python scripts, the snapshot utility (to save the molecule to an image), and the Windows and Unix installers.</li>
	  <li>Private repositories that are for research projects and FIRST robotics in highschool.</li>
	</ul>
