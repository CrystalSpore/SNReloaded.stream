    <p>Hello all! o/</p>
    <p>Welcome to my blog and thank you for spending time to hear the ramblings of my thoughts and experiences. I mostly sat down one day and wanted to chronicle my thoughts. That's usually a good thing to do as told by councilors, right? In any case, here we go!</p>
    <p>This first post is basically to state some of the things that I'll be talking about in later posts (in generic. I don't have everything all planned out.) For example, I'll be discussing some of the CS work that I have done, including dabblings, formal learning, and research situations that I have worked on/in. Another topic in general that I'd be talking about is my experiences as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. (Just to get it out of the way, Yes, I'm Trans.) Finally, I will talk about some of my thoughts about video games, websites, and technology in general, so get ready for some opinions on those things!</p>
    <p>This wraps up the first post. I will be doing a post about my beginning knowledge of linux in the near future!</p>
