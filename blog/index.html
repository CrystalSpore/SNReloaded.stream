    <p>Hi, you've reached [ <a href="http://snreloaded.stream/blog">SNReloaded.stream/blog</a> ]! You now get to hear me ramble about code, games, and life stuff in general!</p>

    <p>There are 3 key things about the blog portion of my site. 1) I will try to attach [tags], 2) I will try to put down #Trigger Warnings#, and 3) There is a lot of learning and growth going on here, so I might make mistakes. Please be nice to me! : D</p>
