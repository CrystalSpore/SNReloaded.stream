		<p>Hi, you've reached [<a href="/">SNReloaded.stream</a>]!</p>
		<p>I hand coded all of the source code for this website. If you are interested in the code for the site, I have uploaded the code to GitHub. Formatting nudged by <a href="https://twitter.com/NadirRift">@NadirRift</a>.</p>
		<hr />
		<p>Below is a listing of some of the pages on my site, and a description of them. Hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="about/">My about page</a>, which contains words about me (and links to other sites).</li>
		  <li><a href="github/">GitHub Info</a>, which links to my GitHub account and also lists some of the projects that I have worked on.</li>
		  <li><a href="tips/">Tip Jar</a>, which links to my *gasp* tip jar. Basically if you wish to give me monitary support, this would be the best location to do so.</li>
		  <li><a href="credits/">Credits</a>, where I thank people & groups that support me.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>One last thing! I highly suggest using the Brave Browser! It is a privacy first browser, that eliminates ads in the webpages, and gives you privacy focused ads that you can earn money yourself! If you use my referral link <a href="https://brave.com/snr248">here</a> it will support me, and get you this fantastic browser!</p>
