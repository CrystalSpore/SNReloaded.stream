    <p>Hi, you've reached [ <a href="index.html">SNReloaded.stream</a> ]! Please leave a message at the tone!</p>
    <p>I hand coded all of the source code for this website (and copied some CSS from a friend). If you are interested in the code for the site, I have uploaded the code to GitHub. Formatting nudged by <a href="https://twitter.com/NadirRift">@NadirRift</a>.</p>
