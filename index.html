    <p>Hi, you've reached [ <a href="https://snreloaded.stream">SNReloaded.stream</a> ]! Welcome!</p>

    <p>I hand coded all of the source code for this website (and copied some CSS from a friend). If you are interested in the code for the site, I might eventually upload the code to GitHub, but currently you can right-click and choose "view page source".</p>
