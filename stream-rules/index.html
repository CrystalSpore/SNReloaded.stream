		  <p>My pronouns are They/Them & She/Her. Please respect that and refer to me appropriately.</p>
		  <p>DO NOT type in all CAPS. It's unlikely to be read if you do, and a mod or bot will likely purge it.</p>
		  <p>Request a mod to post links. If you are not a subscriber, links will be auto-purged unless a mod has permitted you to post it.</p>
		  <p>DO NOT be rude, vulgar, transphobic, homophobic, racist, sexist, a bully or anything of the sort in chat.</p>
		  <p>DO NOT argue with the mods, including the bots as they know the channel rules, as the mods and rules are set by MYSELF. They are doing what I have asked of them. If you find a mod to have unfairly done something, send me a private message on Twitch or Discord, do not argue with them in the chat.</p>
		  <p>DO NOT spam mods. They are volunteering their time. If something is truly important, do feel free to message them about anything.</p>
		  <p>Above all, have a fun and safe time in the channel! Thank you for checking out my channel ^.^</p>
