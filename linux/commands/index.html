	<p>This page is a list of commands that I commonly use when using linux (I use a Debian based system, but most of these commands will still be the same). Hopefully these commands will help you improve your efficiency with linux!</p>

	  <tr>
	    <td>sudo</td>
	    <td>Used to elevate a command to root level. <i>Windows equivalent would be running something as Adinistrator</i></td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>sudo -i <i>OR</i> sudo bash</td>
	    <td>Are you needing to run a lot of root level commands? Just use one of these commands and it will raise you to root level. (I personally use <i>sudo bash</i> for clarity)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
	    <td>apt</td>
	    <td>Used on Debian based systems (such as Ubuntu) to install applications/utilities from the terminal. Typically needs a root level permission.</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
	<p>I am working on expanding this table. More updates will be coming...</p>
