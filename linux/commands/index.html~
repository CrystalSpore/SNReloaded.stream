	<p>Welcome to my Linux portal, where I will be discussing important aspects from a CS (and normal user) standpoint. I will cover commands that I commonly use, and explain what they do, as well as explaining some workarounds and/or fixes for certain problems that you may come across.</p>
	<p>I will be dividing up the information between a coupl of different pages so that everything is very neat and clean. I will have a page for <a href="./commands/">commands</a>, and a page for <a href="./fix-me/">fixes</a> (and possibly more as I think of more things to add/document).</p>

	<p><b><i>Things to keep in mind:</i><b></p>
	<ul>
	  <li>I am not a Linux expert.</li>
	  <li>These are my preferences, and software that I install might not be the solution for you.</li>
	  <li>I am not responsible for broken computers. Do stuff at your own risk.</li>
